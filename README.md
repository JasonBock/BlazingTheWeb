# Blazing the Web - Building Web Applications in C#
This repository contains the demo code used in the presentation. Note that the component testing project (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Testing`) can be found [here](https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/BlazorUnitTestingPrototype).

If you want to run the "Sequence - Grpc" component, make sure the `BlazingTheWeb.ServiceHost` project is up and running.
